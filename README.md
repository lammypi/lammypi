Hi, I’m Liv! 

I'm a UX researcher interested in applying data science to UX data, and a student in Georgia Tech's OMSA program. 

As a researcher, I realize there's a large variety of data floating around in companies that UX teams can make use of, so it's my goal to find that data, gather as much knowledge as possible from it, and share it with my colleagues.
