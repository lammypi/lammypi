Hi, I’m Liv! 

I'm a research and analytics professional dedicated to increasing the value of UX research through the incorporation of analytics methods. What does that look like?
- Clustering to support data-driven persona development based on attitudinal and behavioral data 💁
- Network analytics to map out cognitive models 🕸️
- Topic modeling and sentiment analysis of open ended user feedback 📖
- Creating methods and measures for monitoring content strategies 📊

As a researcher, I realize there's a variety of data floating around in companies that UX teams can make use of, so it's my goal to find that data, gather as much knowledge as possible from it, and share it with my colleagues. In my experience, analytics methods provide the best way of supplementing traditional UXR activities like interviews, user tests, or observational studies.
