Hi, I’m Leslie!

I'm a UX researcher interested in applying data science to UX data. At the moment I'm new to everything about data science, and so I am learning python, R, julia, and the basic principles of data science at the same time. Most of my projects are done via Jupyter Notebooks, though the bulk of the code available here will be in individual files. This is because most of my learning and experimentation is done via my job, and so I cannot share entire notebooks without violating my terms of employment.

Please keep in mind that I am not a data analyst or data scientist, and I make no claim to be. I simply understand that there is a lot more data available to UX teams than they might realize, and I want to develop the skills to get the most out of that data. As such, my code will be very unrefined, though I will update it as I find ways of refining it through repeated application in my projects.

If you'd like to chat with me, please reach out to me via LinkedIn at https://linkedin.com/in/lesliemcfarlin . I am also working on my portfolio site at https://lesliemcfarlin.com .
