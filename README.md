- 👋 Hi, I’m @lammypi
- 👀 I'm a UX researcher interested in applying data science to UX data.
- 🌱 At the moment I'm new to everything about data science, and so I am learning python and the basic principles of data science at the same time.
- 💞️ Right now I'm stumbling through things on my own via EdX, Udemy, and YouTube, so I can't really collaborate with anyone on anything.
- 📫 If you'd like to chat with me, please reach out to me via LinkedIn at https://linkedin.com/in/lesliemcfarlin
