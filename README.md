Hi, I’m Liv! 

I'm a UX researcher interested in applying data science to UX data. There's a large variety of data floating around in companies that UX teams can make use of, so it's my goal to find that data, gather as much knowledge as possible from it, and share it with my colleagues.

You may notice that the repositories are a bit sparse. This is because most of my learning and experimentation is done via my job, and so I cannot share entire notebooks without violating my terms of employment. Simply put- it takes me a bit of time to make sure my work samples lack any identifying content.

As you're looking at my GitHub, please keep in mind that I am not a data analyst or data scientist. __I have never claimed that, and I will never claim that.__ I simply understand that there is a lot more data available to UX teams than they might realize, and I want to develop the skills to help my teams get the most out of that data.

If you'd like to chat with me, please reach out to me via LinkedIn at https://linkedin.com/in/lesliemcfarlin .
