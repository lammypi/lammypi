Hi, I’m Liv! 

I'm a UX researcher who applies data analytics to UX.  While I perform all of the traditional UXR activities such as interviews and user tests, I also:
- Use clustering methods to help build personas 💁
- Apply network analysis as way of understanding user attitudes 💭
- Develop and maintain LLM-based tools to assist with data analysis 💻
- Create custom methods for assessing online strategy 📶

As a researcher, I realize there's a large variety of data floating around in companies that UX teams can make use of, so it's my goal to find that data, gather as much knowledge as possible from it, and share it with my colleagues.

🔆 My Skills
- Data analytics
