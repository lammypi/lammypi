Hi, I’m Leslie! (But most people call me Liv.)

I'm a UX researcher interested in applying data science to UX data. At the moment I'm new to everything about data science, and so I am learning python, R, julia, and the basic principles of data science at the same time. Most of my projects are done via JupyterLab and the occasional individual python file. At work I use JupyterLab as well as RStudio.

You may notice that the repositories are a bit sparse. This is because most of my learning and experimentation is done via my job, and so I cannot share entire notebooks without violating my terms of employment. It takes me a bit of time to generate fake-yet-similar data, and then adjust the analyses I perform on that data.

As you're looking at my GitHub, please keep in mind that I am not a data analyst or data scientist. __I have never claimed that, and I will never claim that.__ I simply understand that there is a lot more data available to UX teams than they might realize, and I want to develop the skills to get the most out of that data.

If you'd like to chat with me, please reach out to me via LinkedIn at https://linkedin.com/in/lesliemcfarlin . I am also working on my portfolio site at https://lesliemcfarlin.com .
